The **Gorges** family can be traced back to the late 1600s in the region near Magdeburg in Sachsen (today, the Sachsen-Anhalt in the eastern part of Germany). The direct ancestors of the Wisconsin Gorgeses were stonemasons and bricklayers. In the 1810s, two sons - August (b. 1781) and Friedrich (b. 1793) moved to Pommern (Pomerania), near the Baltic coast in what is now northwestern Poland. These brothers and their families lived in the Pomeranian counties of Saatzig and Naugard for about 30 years. Most of the family moved to the United States in the 1850s, beginning with [[person:I0006|Caroline Gorges]] in 1855.
